              Organizational transformation introduces uncertainty, competing priorities,
              consequential decisions, and risks that evolve over time. Whether an organization is
              implementing enterprise technology, adopting artificial intelligence, or navigating
              significant institutional change, effective governance requires more than policies,
              committees, and periodic status reports.
            </p>
            <p>
              It requires a disciplined approach to ensuring that decision-makers have the
              information, authority, accountability, and evidence needed to act.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Transformidable Governance Method (TGM) provides a practical framework for
              examining, designing, and strengthening governance throughout organizational
              transformation.

            <div className="prose" style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>
              <p>
                TGM is organized around six interconnected disciplines that operate continuously
                rather than as sequential project phases.
              </p>
              {DISCIPLINES.map((d) => (

            <h2 className="case-h">Governance as a Continuous Discipline</h2>
            <div className="prose" style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>
              <p>The six disciplines are mutually reinforcing.</p>
              <p>
                An organization may have accurate information but unclear decision authority. It may
                assign accountability without establishing escalation mechanisms. It may receive
                evidence of deteriorating conditions but fail to respond.
              </p>
              <p>
                TGM examines these relationships rather than treating governance activities as
                isolated functions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Together, the six disciplines create a continuous connection between visibility,
                authority, accountability, escalation, evidence, and action.

            <div className="prose" style={{ marginTop: 0 }}>
              <p>The governance disciplines are applied through a five-stage improvement lifecycle:</p>

              </ol>
              <p>
                The lifecycle provides a structured approach to strengthening governance while the
                six disciplines describe the capabilities that effective governance must sustain.

                The Transformidable Governance Method can be applied across a range of organizational
                settings, including:

                The Transformidable Governance Method is an evolving framework. As additional cases
                are examined and practical applications are evaluated, its definitions, instruments,
                and supporting guidance may be refined.
