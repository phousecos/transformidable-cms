    term: "Governance",
    question: "How do governance decisions influence organizational outcomes?",
    body: "Outcomes, whether success or failure, are usually traced back to strategy, technology, or an individual. This thread traces them further back, to the decisions, and the decision rights, that actually produced them: who had authority, who was accountable, and what happened when the two didn't line up.",
  },
  {
    term: "Leadership",
    question: "What leadership behaviors enable successful transformation?",
    body: "Transformation is announced far more often than it is sustained. This thread studies the observable behaviors, not the stated intentions, that move change from a plan on paper to something an organization actually carries through.",
  },
  {
    term: "Institutions",
    question: "Why do some organizations become resilient while others fail?",
    body: "Resilience is rarely visible until it's tested. This thread studies what resilient organizations built before the stress event arrived, and what was missing in the ones that didn't hold.",
  },
  {
    term: "Technology",
    question: "How is technology actually governed, independent of outcome?",
    body: "This is the thread with a published research instrument: the Technology Governance Codebook, an outcome-neutral framework for coding how authority, oversight, risk, and accountability actually operate around technology decisions, regardless of whether the initiative ultimately succeeded or failed.",

  {
    term: "Evidence",
    question: "What does the public record reveal about governance and outcomes?",
    body: "Litigation, audits, and public records document governance decisions more candidly than most organizations ever will voluntarily. This thread reads that public record for the decisions, across favorable, adverse, and mixed outcomes, that actually shaped what happened.",

            <p>
              The objective of the Transformidable research program is not to catalog technology
              failures or prescribe a universal model of good governance.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is to build a systematic body of evidence about how technology is governed in
              practice; how authority, accountability, oversight, risk, information, policy,
              escalation, and intervention operate across different contexts; and how those
              governance mechanisms relate to institutional consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, comparative analysis of that evidence should allow Transformidable to
              identify recurring patterns, test governance propositions, develop evidence-based
              frameworks, and improve the practice of technology governance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Five questions organize how that evidence is gathered. Each is pursued through primary
              case research, then published as case files, articles, and reports.
