                <strong>Research is independent.</strong> Transformidable research, including Case Files, is never
                commissioned by, funded by, or reviewed by advisory clients.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No vendor compensation.</strong> We do not resell, implement, or accept referral fees,
                commissions, or sponsorship from technology vendors whose products we may assess.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Case selection is ours.</strong> Advisory engagements do not influence which cases we study or
                publish, and we do not publish confidential client information.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Clear contracting.</strong> Advisory engagements are contracted through {ADVISORY_ENTITY}, an
                affiliate of Transformidable.
