/**
 * GovernanceOutcomes — a case file's coded findings, one table per question.
 *
 * The method asks five things of every coded segment (Technology Governance
 * Codebook §8, §9, §11). This renders one stacked-bar table per question, each
 * broken down by governance domain, from the same set of findings:
 *
 *   Q1  Was it set up?            Q3  How solid is the proof?
 *   Q2  Did it work in practice?  Q4  Did it matter?        Overall  Did it work?
 *
 * Only narrative findings are tallied. Recommendations, entity responses,
 * auditor comments and recommendation follow-ups are stored and remain part of
 * the record, but an entity's account of itself is not a finding about it, and
 * a recommendation is not yet one. The counts here reproduce the four-questions
 * summary sheet exactly, which is why that sheet is never imported.
 *
 * A finding is counted under its PRIMARY domain only. Secondary domains are
 * recorded on the finding but not tallied: counting one finding under every
 * domain it touches would inflate every total and double-count one piece of
 * evidence.
 *
 * Encoding notes, all deliberate:
 *
 * - Bars are scaled by COUNT against the busiest domain in that table, not
 *   stretched to equal width. At two or three findings per domain, a full-width
 *   bar reading "100% fell short" overstates the evidence; here bar length is
 *   how much evidence there is and the segments are its composition.
 * - Verdict scales (Q1, Q2, Overall) are colored good -> serious. Q3 and Q4 are
 *   NOT verdicts — weak evidence is a fact about the record, and "no link to
 *   outcome" is a clean result, not a bad one — so those read as an ordinal
 *   ramp instead. `kind` on each question decides which.
 * - The indeterminate answer in every scale ("Unclear", "Not evidenced", "Not
 *   enough evidence") is hatched as well as grey: it is the absence of a
 *   conclusion rather than one more verdict, and the hatching is what keeps it
 *   separable from the serious step for red-blind readers.

 * Findings that count toward the tables: narrative findings with a domain.

 * A blank segment type counts as a narrative finding, matching the field's own

 * field was added, so every row written before it — the seeded placeholders,
 * anything typed in the admin early on — carries a blank. Requiring an explicit
 * value there meant a row with a domain and all five answers coded still
 * silently failed to appear, with nothing on the page to say which field was
 * missing. Nobody chooses "blank" to mean "not a finding".
 *
 * This does not weaken the exclusion the field exists for: the importer always
 * writes an explicit type, so a recommendation, entity response, auditor
 * comment or follow-up loaded from a coding sheet still carries its real type
